Part of my thesis work involves modeling a cylindrical plasma, 
and examining what happens when neutral molecules hit it.
If the plasma density is low enough, the neutrals might pass straight through.
If the density is higher, they could be elastically scattered by plasma particles.
Or, if the density and temperature are high, they could be ionized.
If they are ionized, at what radius does that typically occur?
What is the distribution of ionization radii as a function of the incoming particle's velocities and the mean free time before ionization?

This post will attempt to lay the groundwork for examining the above issues,
by calculating the average distance that particles encountering a transparent, infinite cylinder pass through it before leaving.
